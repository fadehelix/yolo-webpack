# yolo-webpack
Trivial boilerplate for webpack, babel, jest and sass.

## How to use it?
1. Clone this repo
2. `cd` into already created directory
3. `npm run build`
4. `npm start`

Now webpack dev server is watching for changes in `src/` directory

## How to run tests?
Just write some test scenarios then run `npm test` command.

## Eslint configuration
I love the [Airbnb Javascript Style Guide](https://github.com/airbnb/javascript) so I decided to extend eslint with it.
